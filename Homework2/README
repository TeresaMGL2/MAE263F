The code for simulation is provided in Problem1.m 
Please alter the timespan, timestep, number of nodes, and other physical parameters on the top "Parameter" section. Plotting function of the rod is inside the numerical section and is defaulted to plot at the beginning, the end, and every 200 time steps. The plotting of z-coordinate of xn is behind the numerical section.

Acknowledgement:
Many of the function called in the simulation are borrowed or altered from the class 6 code.
